# Dojo

A dojo is a hall or space where people can learn or meditate in an immersive environment. 
This is most commonly seen in the realm of martial arts, but it's also becoming more common in other industries like meditation and software development. 
In Japanese, the word literally means "place of the Way."

This space contains the problems that I found interesting from CodeWars.
