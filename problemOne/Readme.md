Calculate the number of integers in the decimal representation of n^2, n^3, 2^n, n!, n^n if n = 100,1000,10000,100000,1000000. Your answer should be in tabular form. You can make your life easier by using the decadic logarithm in Python. The number of digits in a number x is [log10(x))] unless the number is a power of 10, in which case you have to add one. Use the ceiling of the number x which is implemented in Python as math.ceil. Alternatively, you can convert the result into a string and then call len on the string. But be prepared to wait.
